Designed and implemented a TCP receiver, incorporating a ‘Bytestream’ for data handling and a ‘Reassembler’ to ensure proper sequencing of received segments. Developed a TCP receiver interface to manage byte stream and segment 
reassembly, including handling sequence numbers with 32-bit wrapping. Ensured reliable data transmission and flow control using acknowledgment numbers and window sizes.
